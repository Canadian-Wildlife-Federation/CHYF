# About CHyF Software

The Common Hydrology Features (CHyF) open source software, demonstrated on the CHyF Pilot Demo, 
was developed by Refractions Research for Natural Resources Canada. 
CHyF is a hydrological features model derived from the OGC’s HY_Features 
([OGC® WaterML 2: Part 3 - Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) - Conceptual Model](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html)). 
CHyF extends HY_Features and provides an implementation.
