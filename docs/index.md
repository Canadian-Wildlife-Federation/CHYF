# Common Hydrology Features (CHyF) Project

## What is CHyF?

CHyF is a hydrological features model derived from the OGC’s HY_Features 
([OGC® WaterML 2: Part 3 - Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) - Conceptual Model](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html)). 
CHyF extends HY_Features and provides an implementation.

## CHyF in action

A demo application is available at : [http://chyf.ca](http://chyf.ca/chyf)

## Who is behind CHyF?

The open source software and the demo viewer was developed by Refractions Research for the Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation [(CCMEO)](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geomatics/10776), Natural Resources Canada.
